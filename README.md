# ðŸ”Œ PowerCo Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict **customer churn** for **PowerCo**, an energy provider, using machine learning techniques. It explores customer behavior through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, feature engineering, and a predictive model built with **Random Forest**.

## ðŸ“Š Project Workflow
1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Understand data distribution and key patterns.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Training (Random Forest)**: Build and evaluate a predictive model for churn classification.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Random Forest Classifier, Feature Engineering)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (For step-by-step analysis)
